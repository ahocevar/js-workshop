JavaScript Basics for Geospatial Web Applications
=================================================

When software developers are confronted with JavaScript for the first time,
they often think of it as a script language that is used to enhance web pages
with image rollovers or other fancy effects.

There is nothing wrong about this, but as a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript
can also be used in a fully object oriented way. Also, JavaScript is more
widely spread than developers coming from other languages may think. All modern
web applications use JavaScript when running in a web browser.

In this module, we will be learning about JavaScript as an object oriented
language, with an eye on how it is used to build web applications with Ext JS,
GeoExt and OpenLayers. The target audience for this module are software
developers that are new to JavaScript.
